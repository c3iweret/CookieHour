### Meetings In Future

Our team will meet at least once a week. This meeting is preferred to take place on Mondays during class time from 4pm to 5pm for the members of our team.

### Shared Documents

Our team will use google documents for rough work and for meeting notes. This is because google documents makes it easy for the team to collaborate on deliverables in real time. Once the document is polished and complete, it will be pushed to the github repo and written in markdown.

### Development Process

We will be using Kanban as our methodology for software development. We will use the Trello board to to visualize work and optimize the flow of the work among the team. Our board will have a four-step workflow: To Be Taken, In Progress, To Be Reviewed and Done. Members of the team will be able to track the progress of work in a visual manner and the board will be used as a single source of truth. Once a task is completed and it is moved to "To Be Reviewed" , the person who worked on it should write a  brief comment detailing what they did. 

So far we have primed our backlog with the deliverables needed for our project's phase 1, setting up our test frameworks and stories related to having our vertical slice set up. We are using story points to size our tasks. Each coloured label represents a certain amount of story points as follows: Yellow - 1, Orange - 2, Green - 3 and Pink - 5. We will only use labels for technical work ,thereby written deliverables will not have story points. Furthermore we will see labels for other types of labeling including, blue for document, purple for test and red for urgent tasks.

The scrum master will be Kyra, who will ensure tasks are being done and assigned to someone at all times.

### Github Collaboration

Every member will fork the repo and create their own branch and work within that repo. To get their code committed, the group member must send a PR to the master repo where it has to be reviewed by at least two members of the team. After the PR is reviewed and accepted then it will be accepted into the repo. We will operate under the rule that every commit should not break the existing code. Every commit should be accompanied by tests that will be pass the Travis environment.

### Group Messaging
We will use Slack to communicate regularly and have channels such as general, project, frontend, backend, test and random. We will integrate Slack with Trello. We have also agreed to use Facebook in the case of emergencies in order to get quicker replies.

### Tracking Progress
We will track our progress using story points between phases.
