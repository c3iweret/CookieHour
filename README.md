How to run:

-Check out the code(git clone the repository)

- cd into the 'project' folder

- run npm install in project folder, cd into server folder and type npm install and cd into client folder and type npm install

-go back to project folder and type 'npm start ' and it will start both client and server. No need for two terminals

-to run tests: go to project folder and type 'npm test' and all tests for frontend and backend should run

### IF THE ABOVE DOESN'T WORK, DO IT THE OLD WAY:

- in one terminal window, cd into server folder and type "npm install", then "node server.js"

- in a second terminal window, cd into client folder and type "npm install", then "npm start" (or alternatively "node_modules/.bin/react-scripts start" if the former doesn't work)

- The client side should open up in a browser from here but if it does not, you can always type localhost:3000 in your browser

- To run frontend tests, open a new terminal window, cd into client/src and type "npm test"

- To run backend tests, open a new terminal window, cd into server and type "npm test"
